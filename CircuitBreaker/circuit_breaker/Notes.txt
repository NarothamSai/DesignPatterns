There are instances when we want to get data from other servers.
When the other server is down for some time
and incoming requests increases, 
the calling of the other server may lead to
1. Waiting time 
2. Resource exhausation lke network, memory increase etc

One of the statergy to mitigate this is using Circuit Breaker Pattern

At success, the request will go through.
At Failure, the request will go through but will wait upto failure threshold.
We will try calling the other server upto failure threshold 
then just throw error , not calling the other server.
After some timeout, giving the time for other server to come up.
We will try again calling the other server.

It will be similar to electrical circuit breaker
If its in CLOSED state, the current goes through
If its in OPEN state, the current does not go through



lets Keep the states
Green
RED
